## Adopter types 

See CNCF [definition of an adopter](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/FAQ.md#what-is-the-definition-of-an-adopter) <br>

Any single company can fall under several categories at once in which case it should enumerate all that apply and only be listed once
- **End-User** (CNCF member) - Companies and organizations who are End-User members of the CNCF
- **Another project** - an open source project that leverages a CNCF project as part of their solution, integrates with for compatibility and interoperability,
  or is used in the supply chain of another project
- **end users** (non CNCF member)- companies and organizations that are not CNCF End-User members that use the project and cloud native technologies internally, or build upon
  a cloud native open source project but do not sell the cloud native project externally as a service offering (those are Service Providers). This group is identified in the written
  form by the convention end user, uncapitalized and unhyphenated
- **Service Provider** - a Service Provider is an organization that repackages an open source project as a core component of a service offering, sells cloud native services externally.
  A Service Provider’s customers are considered transitive adopters and should be excluded from identification within the ADOPTERS.md file.
  Examples of Service Providers (and not end users) include cloud providers (e.g., Alibaba Cloud, AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure), some infrastructure software vendors,
  and telecom operators (e.g., AT&T, China Mobile)
- **Consultancy** - an entity whose purpose is to assist other organizations in developing a solution leveraging cloud native technology. They may be embedded in the end user team and
  is responsible for the execution of the service. Service Providers may also provide consultancy services, they may also package cloud native technologies for reuse
  as part of their offerings. These function as proxies for an end user
