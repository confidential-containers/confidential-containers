# v<TARGET_RELEASE>

## Code freeze

- [ ] 1. Update Enclave CC to use the latest commit from image-rs

    * https://github.com/confidential-containers/enclave-cc/blob/main/src/enclave-agent/Cargo.toml
      * Change the revision
      * Run `cargo update -p image-rs`

- [ ] 2. Update Kata Containers to use the latest commit from image-rs, attestation-agent and td-shim

    * image-rs
      * https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/CCv0/src/agent/Cargo.toml
      * Change the revision
      * Run `cargo update -p image-rs`
    * attestation-agent and td-shim
      * https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/CCv0/versions.yaml
        * Change the version

- [ ] 3. Wait for kata-runtime-payload-ci to be successfully built
    * After the previous PR is merged wait for the kata-runtime-payload-ci (https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/actions/workflows/cc-payload-after-push.yaml) has completed, so the latest kata-runtime-payload-ci contains the changes

- [ ] 4. Check if there are new changes in the pre install payload script

    * https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/tree/main/install/pre-install-payload
      * The last commit there must match what's in the following files as preInstall / postUninstall image
        * Enclave CC: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/enclave-cc/base/ccruntime-enclave-cc.yaml
        * Kata Containers:
              Note that for Kata Containers, we're looking for the newTag, below the quay.io/confidential-containers/reqs-payload image
          * default: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/ccruntime/default/kustomization.yaml

- [ ] 5. Ensure the Operator is using the latest CI builds and that the Operator tests are passing

    * Enclave CC:
      * SIM: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/enclave-cc/sim/kustomization.yaml
      * HW: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/enclave-cc/base/ccruntime-enclave-cc.yaml
      * Note that we need the quay.io/confidential-containers/runtime-payload-ci registry and enclave-cc-{SIM,HW}-latest tags
    * Kata Containers:
      * default: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/ccruntime/default/kustomization.yaml
      * s390x: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/ccruntime/s390x/kustomization.yaml
      * peer-pods: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/ccruntime/peer-pods/kustomization.yaml
          Note that we need the quay.io/confidential-containers/runtime-payload-ci registry and kata-containers-latest tag

- [ ] 6. Update peer-pods with latest commits of kata-containers and attestation-agent and test it, following the [release candidate testing process](https://github.com/confidential-containers/cloud-api-adaptor/blob/main/docs/Release-Process.md#release-candidate-testing)
    
- [ ] 7. Cut an attestation-service v<TARGET_RELEASE> and make images for AS and RVPS, if changes happened in the project.

       * https://github.com/confidential-containers/attestation-service
       * Cut a release (AS/RVPS images will be automatically built triggered by release)

- [ ] 8. Cut a guest-components v<TARGET_RELEASE> release

- [ ] 9. Cut a td-shim v<TARGET_RELEASE> release, if changes happened in the project

- [ ] 10. Update kbs to use the tagged attestation-service and guest-components, cut a release and make image

       * https://github.com/confidential-containers/kbs/blob/main/src/api/Cargo.toml
         * Change the revision for the `as-types` and `attestation-service` crates (both use `v<TARGET_RELEASE>`) and update the lock file
       * https://github.com/confidential-containers/kbs/blob/main/tools/client/Cargo.toml
         * Change the revision for the `as-types` and `kbs_protocol` crates (both use `v<TARGET_RELEASE>`)
       * Cut a release
         * kbs image will be automatically built triggered by release, so ensure that the [release workflow](https://github.com/confidential-containers/kbs/actions/workflows/release.yaml) ran successfully

- [ ] 11. Update Enclave CC to use the released version of image-rs

    * redo step 1, but now using v<TARGET_RELEASE>

- [ ] 12. Update Kata Containers to the latest released version of:

    * image-rs and attestation-agent (redo step 2, but now using the v<TARGET_RELEASE>)

- [ ] 13. Update the operator to use the images generated from the latest commit of both Kata Containers and Enclave CC

    * redo step 5, but now targetting the latest payload image generated for Kata Containers and Enclave CC

- [ ] 14. Make sure all the operator tests are passing

- [ ] 15. Cut an Enclave CC release

- [ ] 16. Add a new Kata Containers tag

- [ ] 17. Wait for release kata-runtime-payload to be successfully built
    * After the Kata tag is created wait for (https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/actions/workflows/cc-payload.yaml) to be successfully completed, so the latest commit kata-runtime-payload for the release is created

- [ ] 18. Update peer pods to use the release versions and then cut a release following the [documented flow](https://github.com/confidential-containers/cloud-api-adaptor/blob/main/docs/Release-Process.md#cutting-releases)
