# v<TARGET_RELEASE>

## Code freeze

- [ ] - 1. Update image-rs to use the latest commit from ocicrypt-rs
        
        * https://github.com/confidential-containers/image-rs/blob/main/Cargo.toml
          * Change the revision
          * Run `cargo update -p ocicrypt-rs`

- [ ] - 2. Update image-rs to use the latest commit from attestation-agent

        * https://github.com/confidential-containers/image-rs/blob/main/Cargo.toml
          * Change the revision
          * Run `cargo update -p attestation_agent`

- [ ] - 3. Update Enclave CC to use the latest commit from image-rs

        * https://github.com/confidential-containers/enclave-cc/blob/main/src/enclave-agent/Cargo.toml
          * Change the revision
          * Run `cargo update -p image-rs`
        Note that you can point to your own fork here, so you don't actually do changes in the other projects
        before making sure this step works as expected.

- [ ] - 4. Update Kata Containers to use the latest commit from image-rs, attestation-agent and td-shim

        * image-rs
          * https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/CCv0/src/agent/Cargo.toml
          * Change the revision
          * Run `cargo update -p image-rs`
          Note that you can point to your own fork here, so you don't actually do changes in the other projects
          before making sure this step works as expected.
        * attestation-agent and td-shim
          * https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/CCv0/versions.yaml
            * Change the version

- [ ] - 5. Wait for kata-runtime-payload-ci to be successfully built
        * After the previous PR is merged wait for the kata-runtime-payload-ci (https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/actions/workflows/cc-payload-after-push.yaml) has completed, so the latest kata-runtime-payload-ci contains the changes

- [ ] - 6. Check if there are new changes in the pre install payload script

        * https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/tree/main/install/pre-install-payload
          * The last commit there must match what's in the following files as preInstall / postUninstall image
            * Enclave CC: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/enclave-cc/base/ccruntime-enclave-cc.yaml
            * Kata Containers:
              Note that for Kata Containers, we're looking for the newTag, below the quay.io/confidential-containers/container-engine-for-cc-payload image
              * default: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/ccruntime/default/kustomization.yaml

- [ ] - 7. Ensure the Operator is using the latest CI builds and that the Operator tests are passsing

        * Enclave CC:
          * SIM: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/enclave-cc/sim/kustomization.yaml
          * HW: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/enclave-cc/base/ccruntime-enclave-cc.yaml
          * Note that we need the quay.io/confidential-containers/runtime-payload-ci registry and enclave-cc-{SIM,HW}-latest tags
        * Kata Containers:
          * default: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/ccruntime/default/kustomization.yaml
          * peer-pods: https://github.com/confidential-containers/operator/blob/main/config/samples/ccruntime/peer-pods/kustomization.yaml
          Note that we need the quay.io/confidential-containers/runtime-payload-ci registry and kata-containers-latest tag
