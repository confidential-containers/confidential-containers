# Confidential Containers Roadmap

When looking at the project's roadmap we distinguish between the short-term roadmap (2-6 months) vs. the mid/long-term roadmap (6-18 months):
- The [short term roadmap](#short-term-roadmap) is focused on achieving an end-to-end, easy to deploy and stable confidential containers solution. We track this work on a number of github boards.
- The [mid and long term roadmap](#mid-and-long-term-roadmap) focuses on use case driven development.

# Short Term Roadmap
The short-term roadmap is based on our github boards and delivered through our on-going releases

- [Trustee github board](https://github.com/orgs/confidential-containers/projects/10/views/1)

# Mid and Long Term Roadmap

In CoCo use case driven development we identify the main functional requirements the community requires by focusing on key use cases.

This helps the community deliver releases which address real use cases customers require and focusing on the right priorities. The use case driven development approach also includes developing the relevant CI/CDs to ensure end-to-end use cases the community delivers work over time.

These use cases are outlined on our [website](https://confidentialcontainers.org/docs/use-cases/).
