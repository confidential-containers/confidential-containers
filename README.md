# Welcome to documentation repository for Confidential Containers 

Confidential Containers is an open source community working to leverage 
[Trusted Execution Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment) 
to protect containers and data and to deliver cloud native 
confidential computing.

Our key considerations are:
- Allow cloud native application owners to enforce application security requirements
- Transparent deployment of unmodified containers
- Support for multiple TEE and hardware platforms
- A trust model which separates Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) from guest applications
- Least privilege principles for the Kubernetes cluster administration capabilities which impact 
delivering Confidential Computing for guest applications or data inside the TEE
